# Operating System

This repository contains a really-basic, portable operating
system derived from [nuta/operating-system-in-1000-lines](
https://github.com/nuta/operating-system-in-1000-lines).

## Dependencies

On Ubuntu 25.04, we need these dependencies to compile the kernel:

``` bash
sudo apt install build-essential clang clangd lld llvm
```
